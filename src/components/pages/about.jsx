                After seven long years of bedside nursing, I am ready to sit down.. and CODE! As a critical care nurse, the need for attention to detail, recognition of patterns, and ability to withstand torture for long periods of time has prepared me for a new life in web development. I am so excited to be a part of UPENN's LPS Coding Bootcamp, and look forward to the challenge of learning a new skill that is useful in nearly any industry.
